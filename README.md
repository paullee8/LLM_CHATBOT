# LLM_CHATBOT

I am utilizing Streamlit, Huggingface and Langchain to develop a LLM-powered chatbot. It is able to identify a specific source, such as a URL or a document the user is referring to, simply from an user query. Additionally, incorporating different variables for users to adjust the prompt, such as languages, chatbot modes, styles and temperature, enhances the flexibility and customization of the chatbot. This approach creates a more tailored and efficient user experience.
